# Managing your team

You can only have one team. If you don't already have a team, head to `/get-started/` to create one.

Include as many people as you like in your team. You can invite people to your team by adding their email in a comma delimited list on team creation.

If you need to add members to your team after creating it, reach out to [support](mailto:support@beesocial.io) to manually add them.
